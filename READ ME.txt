Hello!

Our game is called Animal Hunter, and the point is to hunt animals.
You have a limited amount of ammo and once you run out the level switches.

Unfortunately due to a bug we were unable to solve, in order to properly hiy an animal you must aim at its feet (or the space between its front and back legs)
This is due to the center point of the models being located there in the 3D modeling engine, 
and we were unable to find a way to fix it with the limited time alotted. 

Otherwise, everything works as intended! We hope you enjoy!
